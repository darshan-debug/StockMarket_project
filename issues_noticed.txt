The MongoDB Kafka Source Connector relies on a feature called Change Streams to get a real-time stream of data changes from MongoDB. Change Streams are only available on a MongoDB Replica Set or a Sharded Cluster. Your current MongoDB instance is a standalone server, which does not support this feature.
